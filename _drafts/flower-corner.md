To keep up with the theme of spring finally coming, here is another small
freebie for your collection, **flowers** arranged to fit in the corner
of a towel etc. :)

The design is about 91 x 70 mm (3.6 x 2.8 in) and has five colors in total.
One for the stem and leaves, and two each for the two different flower heads.
