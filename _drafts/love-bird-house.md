Spring is coming, slowly but steady :) That's why we decided to create a freebie
to celebrate, a small **love birdhouse**. Hope you enjoy it!

The design is about 90 x 50 mm (3.5 x 2 in) and has officially six different colors,
although you can make the heart outline and the rope holding the house
the same color and it still looks great.

We also tried filling the heart with a satin stitch, however due to its small size,
the heart does not have a perfect shape. If you are interested in this design as
well, or just want to talk to us about a different topic, feel free to reach
out at <a href="mailto:info@myembroids.com">info@myembroids.com</a>, we would
love to hear your thoughts!
