Welcome to MyEmbroids! MyEmbroids is all about helping you organize your machine design collection
without having to spend hours.

Let's be honest - finding a design in a large collection can very frustrating. There are just too many freebies
and good sales around to be not collecting designs, but getting them organized is not so simple. Even
if the designs come with meaningful file names (and we all know that is not always the case), where should be store
it? 

Image you have the following design:

<!-- more -->

	<img width="250" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/imgs/cat-1/min.svg" class="center-horizontal" alt="image">
	<figcaption>
	  meow... MEOW!!!! MEOW!!!!!
	</figcaption>
</figure>

If you are organizing your designs by placing them in folders on your computer, 
where would you put this cat? Maybe in a `cats` folder, maybe in `animals` or maybe 
in a folder with the name of the store? In any case you will have to maintain your folder structure 
and be very disciplined to stick with it.

With MyEmbroids we hope to eliminate this manual sorting once and
for all! Instead of creating large folder structures, we analyze the designs
you upload and automatically sort them for you. When it's time to search a design
it doesn't matter if you type "cat" or "animal", MyEmbroids will find your design
in either case.

Sounds like magic? Unfortunately, it's not! MyEmbroids is made possible
by recent advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning, which is just a fancy
way of saying that computers have become a lot better at understanding the content of images.
Think of self driving cars for example, which weren't possible a couple of years ago.
MyEmbroids is building on the same technology to help you find your designs. Cool, right?
