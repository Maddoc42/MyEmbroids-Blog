With Valentine's Day around the corner, we decided to create a little something
to give away as a present: **a tree full of love and hearts** :)

The design is a little less than 90 x 80 mm (3.5 x 3.1 in) and has two colors.
Brown and red work very well, we also gave it a try with blue hearts which also turned
out nice:
