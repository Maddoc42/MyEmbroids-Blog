With just one day left until Valentine's day, here is another small embroidery
design for your personal collection:
**a heart with leaves** :)


The design is pretty small at about 48 x 43 mm (1.9 x 1.7 in), which makes it ideal for a
little detail for a handbag or pencil case. Red for the heart and green for the leaves works
great, blue also turned out nice:
