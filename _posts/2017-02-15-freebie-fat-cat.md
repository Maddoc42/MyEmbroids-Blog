Here is another small giveaway, this time its a **big round cat**! This cat definitely
had too much to eat, must be the after Christmas season :)

The cat is about 56 x 46 mm (2.2 x 18 in) and has a total of three colors. A light orange
for the body and a lighter red for the stripes work well. We also tried inverting the
colors with a light blue for the stripes and a darker blue for the body, which also
looks great!

The body of the cat is pretty tightly stitched so make sure to not fix your fabric
with too much tension in your hoop, otherwise you might get some not so nice looking
puckers :)

You can download the design below. Happy stitching!
