Easter is coming up in 27 days. Yes I know, still a long way to go, so to start slowly we
are releasing a **little chick in an egg** embroidery freebie :)

The design is a little less than 38 x 53 mm (1.5 x 2.1 in) and has nine colors.
It's Easter we are talking about here, so more colors are better!
