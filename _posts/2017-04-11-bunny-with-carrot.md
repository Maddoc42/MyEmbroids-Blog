Yet another Easter freebie coming up: a **bunny with carrot** :blush: :rabbit: :rabbit2: if you look
close you can see it dreaming about Easter and lots and lots of eggs :wink: :blue_heart:

The bunny is 65 x 88 mm (2.6 x 3.5 in) large and has a total of 5 colors, three for the body
and outline, two for the carrot and heart.
