Previously we had the [big bunny with carrot freebie]({% post_url 2017-04-11-bunny-with-carrot %}),
today you can download the **redwork** version! :blush: :rabbit: :rabbit2: :sunflower:
Happy stitching! :blue_heart:

The bunny is 65 x 88 mm (2.6 x 3.5 in) large and is stitched and has almost no jumps :wink:
