Building an embroidery organizer is though work! :wrench::muscle::nut_and_bolt::smile: because
we don't want to keep you waiting for too long, we built a little something on the side
which might be fun for all the freebie hunters out there: a 
[**freebies library**](https://freebies.myembroids.com)!

<div class="design-download" style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="https://freebies.myembroids.com" class="link-freebie">View freebies</a>
</div>

<!-- more -->

The website shows an overview of freebies available from different shops, sorted by the date they
were released! Whenever a new freebies is available we add it to the top of the website, which means
you don't have to go round hunting for freebies on different sites anymore, its all in one place now!
:rocket::heart:

So far we have received permission from over 20 shops to list their freebies and many more are coming
soon.
