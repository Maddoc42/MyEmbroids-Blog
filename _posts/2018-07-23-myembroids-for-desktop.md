Here is a quick small fun embroidery freebie which fits on almost anything and works with the coming spring: a
**flower corner** :smile: :sunny: :sunflower:

<!-- more -->

The design comes with five colors, two for each flower type and one for the leaves.
And and stitches pretty quickly too :wink:

Previously the files for the freebies were hosted right on this page. Now thanks
to the [freebies library](https://freebies.myembroids.com/) we can put all freebies
on one page!

<div class="design-download" style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="https://freebies.myembroids.com/design/myembroids_com-flower-corner" class="link-freebie">Visit freebie</a>

What is this *freebies library*? The freebies library is a website which shows
which freebies are currently available on the internet.
We have built this site in cooperation with the
designers and only link to designs where we have the permission too. This helps
us with keeping a high quality and making sure the freebies are really up to date :wink: :tada:

Do you want to see your own designs available in the freebies library?
